    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll">It’s really strange, no matter how many times I tell myself that I want to disappear and rot away, something just keeps pushing me forward. Even when everything’s at a standstill, I still want to live.</p>

    <!-- Letter 2 -->
    <img src="assets/images/Chapter7Letter/letter2.png" class="show-on-scroll" alt=letter2>
    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll">Maybe I should write something to Eric, it’s a little awkward to say something after weeks of no communication, but I might as well try.</p>

    <!-- Letter 3 -->
    <img src="assets/images/Chapter7Letter/ellenLetter.png" class="show-on-scroll" alt="letter">
    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll">Well, the letter’s awkward, but what’s done is done.</p>

    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll">A few days later, I received an envelope.</p>

    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll">I’m not sure if it’s right or wrong to feel this way but, I was really moved by his words. The letter wasn’t anything groundbreaking, but it felt really good to read it.</p>

    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll">It’s as if a giant weight had been lifted off of my shoulders.</p>

    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll"><em>I really want to meet him…</em></p>

    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll">I proposed a meet-up at the usual spot, the hill overlooking the city. He accepted without hesitation.</p>

    <p class="thoughts show-on-scroll">Finally, I’m ready to leave, despite the danger…</p>
