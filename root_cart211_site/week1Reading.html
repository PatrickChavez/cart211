  <h1>A Review of <em>As We May Think</em> by Vannevar Bush</h1>
  <p>Dr. Vannevar Bush’s concept of the memex was incredibly ahead of its time: not only was its design a precursor to the modern desktop computer, but its functions also resemble contemporary internet usage. Indeed, it would seem that his talk of trails and the creation of articles based on one’s findings evoke webpage links and Wikipedia, respectively.  The modern computer’s asset of being able to operate by association via search engines is partially based on human cognition. Because of this overlap in behavior, is it logical to say that computers are the next step in human evolution? Their ability to store vast amounts of information means that people are always walking with encyclopedias at the ready. Furthermore, with the prevalence of blogging and social media, people’s entire lives can be preserved for all to see. In addition, the ease of communication via webcam meetings and chat systems helps to keep people in touch despite distance. Our smartphones are basically an extension of our bodies: some cannot live without their phones due to the endless amount of entertainment they provide, in addition to containing multiple methods to get in touch with others. Indeed, with the way computers have affected the modern world, it is fascinating to read about their conceptualization during a time when most scientists were simply building war machines. Dr. Bush’s ideas helped to pave the way for human evolution in terms of record preservation and socialization.</p>
