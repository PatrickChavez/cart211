  <h1>Daniel Joseph Article Review</h1>
  <p>Daniel Joseph’s article emphasizes the fact that Canada is mostly dependent on the US when it comes to digital networks. In fact, America has a stranglehold on the internet as a whole: with Twitter, Facebook and Google being used in the daily lives of millions of people worldwide. While it is possible for Canada to make its own apps and services exclusively catering to Canadians, it would be an uphill battle. The reason for this is that American-owned services like Amazon are wildly popular and accessible, to the point where a Canadian branch is available. Furthermore, creating social media apps would be moot, as Twitter and Facebook have such a strong following and is ingrained in the lives of so many people that there is basically little competition. In terms of establishing a country-owned network: if it were to happen, we would not have to worry about being too technologically dependent on the US. However, many problems we face today regarding privacy and internet usage would still apply: governments could spy on users and sell their data, websites dealing with online transactions could be hacked, leading to the personal info of many stolen and finally, there might be groups willing to repeal net neutrality for their own gain. Just like Daniel Joseph states in his article: even if Canada had its own network, nothing would change. Despite these many problems, as long as net neutrality is upheld and access to information remains free, the internet can still be enjoyed by many.</p>
