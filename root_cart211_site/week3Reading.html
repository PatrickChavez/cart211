  <h1>Review of <em>Web Work</em> by Rachel Greene</h1>
  <p>Rachel Greene’s writing on net.artists and their tendency to play around with the technology presented to them is a trend that continues to this day. Back then, the works of Jodi.org and Vuk Cosic would modify existing sites or computer hardware and allow others to view them in a different light. Nowadays these kinds of transformative works can be seen in communities focusing on video game modification. The general idea is that users take an existing game and change several aspects of it, such as making new levels or gameplay options, sometimes going beyond what the original game was capable of. An example of such a community is the Super Mario World ROM hacking scene: years of poking into the game’s code and occasionally using assembly programming language has led modders to create enhanced graphics, unique enemies and even cutscenes to the classic platformer. In addition, there have even been collaborative projects, such as the Annual Vanilla Level Design Contest; a game containing levels created by multiple users divided by theme and overall quality. Another kind of collaborative work found on the internet is the Reanimated Collab: a video where snippets of an episode from a cartoon are redone by multiple animators. A variety of different visuals are shown: one part might be in traditional animation, while another might be claymated. Indeed, the existence of the internet has led to the possibility of giving a unique spin on existing works, one artist at a time.</p>
